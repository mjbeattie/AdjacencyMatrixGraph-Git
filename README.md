# AdjacencyMatrixGraph-Git


The AdjacencyMatrixGraph solution demonstrates the creation, manipulation, and traversal
of a graph.  Edge information is stored as a zero/one integer in an Adjacency Matrix.
The edge integer can be set at other values to represent the costs of an edge.  The
solution also demonstates depth-first and breadth-first traversal and stores parent
node information in a separate vector.  This solution uses the AdjacencyMatrixGraph.h
file stored in C-Plus-Plus-Header-Files.
